**Why You’ll Love Working With Me:**  
✔️ **Laravel Artisan commands** flow from my fingertips like Shakespearean sonnets  
✔️ I **Vue-tifully** architect frontends (sorry, had to)  
✔️ My **Flutter apps** are so smooth, they make butter jealous 🧈  

**Current Status:**  
🔹 `git push --force`-ing my way through life

## **👨‍💻 About Me (AKA "Why You Should Keep Reading")**  

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** who’s *passionate* about turning caffeine into code and dreams into **404-free** web apps. 🚀  

By day, I craft **dynamic, user-friendly interfaces** so smooth, they make butter jealous. 🧈  
By night, I battle backend bugs like a debugger-wielding superhero. *(Spoiler: Sometimes the bugs win.)* 🐞💥  

My superpower? **Building stuff that works**—most of the time. (We don’t talk about the other times.)  

**Fueled by:**  
☕ Coffee  
💡 Endless curiosity  
😅 The occasional existential crisis when `git merge` goes wrong  

**Life motto:** *"If at first you don’t succeed, `CTRL + Z` and pretend it never happened."*  

## 🚀 Skills & Technologies (AKA My Dev Superpowers)  

### **Frontend Wizardry** 🧙‍♂️  
- **Vue.js**: Making components so reactive, they practically high-five you when data changes. *"Composition API? More like Composition A-Party!"* 🎉  
- **Nuxt.js**: SSR magic that makes Google happy and my apps *blazing fast* (or at least faster than my morning coffee kicks in). ☕⚡  
- **Flutter**: "Write once, run everywhere" (except when it doesn’t… but hey, *most of the time*). 📱💻🖥️  
- **Alpine.js**: When I need interactivity but don’t want to summon the *JavaScript Overlords*. Simple, lightweight, and sneaky powerful. 🏹  
- **Tailwind CSS & Bootstrap**: Because sometimes I *design like Picasso*, and other times I *Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V like a pro*. 🎨✂️  

### **Backend Sorcery** 🔮  
- **Laravel**: Writing PHP that doesn’t make me cry—elegant syntax, powerful tools, and *Artisan commands* that make me feel like a coding wizard. 🧙‍♂️✨  
- **Livewire**: Building reactive UIs without touching JavaScript. *"Wait, I can do that?!"* (Yes, and it’s glorious.) 🚫📜  

## **🛠️ Tools & Practices** *(Or: "How I Keep My Code From Burning Down")*  

- **Version Control**:  
  Git & GitHub – because *"but it worked on my machine!"* is not an acceptable excuse.  
  *(Fun fact: My commit messages range from "Fixed bug" to "Please work I beg you.")* 🙏  

- **CI/CD**:  
  Automating deployments so I don’t have to manually drag-and-drop files like it’s 1999.  
  *(If the pipeline fails, I pretend it’s a "learning opportunity.")* 🚀🔧  

- **Testing**:  
  Writing tests so my future self doesn’t curse my past self.  
  *"It’s not *paranoia* if the code *actually* breaks in prod."* �✔️  


## 🐳 Currently Learning

I'm on a mission to containerize my life with **Docker**—because if it works on my machine, it should work everywhere, right? (Famous last words before `docker-compose up` fails spectacularly 😅)

Also diving deep into **AWS services**—currently trying to understand why my cloud bill is higher than my grocery budget. S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and EC2 instances are my new best friends (and occasional enemies).

*Current Status:*  
🔹 Successfully ran `docker run hello-world` (nailed it!)  
🔹 Accidentally created 17 Elastic Load Balancers (help)  
🔸 "I'll just quickly check AWS docs" *(3 hours later)*
