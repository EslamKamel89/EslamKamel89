## **👨‍💻 About Me**

I’m a **backend developer** fluent in both **Laravel** and **Python (Django / FastAPI)**.
Currently shifting my main stack toward **Python** for modern API development, but still actively delivering **Laravel production systems** — from APIs and queues to CI/CD and real-time features.

I love building systems that are:

* **Clean:** typed, tested, documented
* **Performant:** async-ready, containerized
* **Reliable:** optimized queries, stable queues, predictable deploys

**In transition:** learning how to blend **Python backends + AI/ML** to build smarter, data-driven platforms — one Jupyter cell at a time.

---

## **🚀 Why You'll Enjoy Working With Me**

✔️ **Laravel & Livewire** apps with clean architecture, queues, caching, and multi-tenant setups

✔️ **Django/DRF + FastAPI** APIs — async, typed, tested, containerized

✔️ Docker setups so portable they could run on a toaster

✔️ CI/CD pipelines that keep production calm and predictable


**Fun facts:**

🐧 I talk to my containers when they misbehave

🐍 I think in Python, dream in PHP

☕ I treat caffeine as infrastructure

## **🛠️ Tech Stack 2025**

### **Python Backend**

* **FastAPI** – async APIs, Pydantic models, OAuth2, SQLAlchemy
* **Django + DRF** – admin, ORM, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL
* **Pytest** – testing with fixtures and coverage
* **Docker + Docker Compose** – full dev environments
* **Gunicorn + Nginx** – production serving

### **Laravel & Ecosystem**

* **Laravel 11.x** – REST APIs, Sanctum, queues, caching, notifications
* **Livewire / Volt / Filament** – modern reactive interfaces
* **Inertia.js / Vue / React** – dynamic SPA frontends
* **Stripe / PayPal / WebSockets** – real-time and payments integration

### **Frontend & Mobile**

* **Flutter** – published apps on Play Store & App Store
* **Vue 3 / Nuxt.js / React** – SPAs and admin dashboards
* **Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap** – responsive UI foundations

## **📚 Learning & Growth**

I’m currently pursuing a **2-year AI/ML learning plan (2024–2026)** —
~6 months completed so far.

Focus areas:

* Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
* NLP and RAG (Hugging Face, LangChain)
* Deployment (FastAPI, Docker, AWS)

🧠 Goal: evolve from “backend dev” to “AI-ready backend engineer.”

---

## **🐳 DevOps & Tools**

* **GitHub Actions** – test → build → deploy
* **AWS (EC2, ECS, S3, Route53)** – scalable deployment
* **Postman / pytest / curl** – API testing workflow
* **Nginx / Redis / Docker Compose** – production infrastructure
