## **👨‍💻 About Me**  
*(AKA "Why You Should Keep Reading")*  

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** who's *passionate* about turning caffeine into code and dreams into **404-free** web apps. 🚀  

By day, I craft **dynamic, user-friendly interfaces** so smooth, they make butter jealous. 🧈  
By night, I battle backend bugs like a debugger-wielding superhero. *(Spoiler: Sometimes the bugs win.)* 🐞💥  

**Fueled by:**  
☕ Coffee  
💡 Endless curiosity  
😅 The occasional existential crisis when `git merge` goes wrong  

**Life motto:** *"If at first you don't succeed, `CTRL + Z` and pretend it never happened."*  

---

## **🚀 Why You'll Love Working With Me**  
✔️ **Laravel Artisan commands** flow from my fingertips like Shakespearean sonnets  
✔️ I **Vue-tifully** architect frontends (sorry, had to)  
✔️ My **Flutter apps** are so smooth, they make butter jealous 🧈  

**Current Status:**  
🔹 `git push --force`-ing my way through life  
🔹 Debugging my sleep schedule (segmentation fault)  
🔹 10/10 would `CTRL + S` again

## **🛠️ Skills & Technologies**  
*(AKA My Dev Superpowers)*  

### **Frontend Wizardry** 🧙‍♂️  
- **Vue.js**: Making components so reactive, they practically high-five you when data changes  
- **Nuxt.js**: SSR magic that makes Google happy and my apps *blazing fast*  
- **Flutter**: "Write once, run everywhere" (except when it doesn't... but hey, *most of the time*)  
- **Alpine.js**: When I need interactivity but don't want to summon the *JavaScript Overlords*  
- **Tailwind CSS & Bootstrap**: Because sometimes I *design like Picasso*, and other times I *Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V*  

### **Backend Sorcery** 🔮  
- **Laravel**: Writing PHP that doesn't make me cry—elegant syntax and powerful tools  
- **Livewire**: Building reactive UIs without touching JavaScript (*"Wait, I can do that?!"*)  

---

## **⚙️ Tools & Practices**  
*(Or: "How I Keep My Code From Burning Down")*  

- **Version Control**:  
  Git & GitHub – because *"but it worked on my machine!"* is not an acceptable excuse  
  *(Commit messages range from "Fixed bug" to "Please work I beg you")* 🙏  

- **CI/CD**:  
  Automating deployments so I don't have to manually drag-and-drop files like it's 1999  
  *(If the pipeline fails, I pretend it's a "learning opportunity")* 🚀🔧  

- **Testing**:  
  Writing tests so my future self doesn't curse my past self  
  *"It's not paranoia if the code actually breaks in prod"*

## **🐳 Currently Learning**  
I'm on a mission to containerize my life with **Docker**—because if it works on my machine, it should work everywhere, right?  

Also diving deep into **AWS services**—currently trying to understand why my cloud bill is higher than my grocery budget.  

*Current Status:*  
🔹 Successfully ran `docker run hello-world` (nailed it!)  
🔹 Accidentally created 17 Elastic Load Balancers (help)  
🔸 "I'll just quickly check AWS docs" *(3 hours later)*

## **⌨️ Keyboard Ninja Skills**  

```javascript
const typingStats = {
  wpm: {
    burstMode: "67 WPM (1 min)",   // When caffeine hits just right
    sustained: "64 WPM (3 min)",   // "I'm in the zone" speed
    documentation: "64 WPM (1 page)", // Writing docs under duress
    endurance: "58 WPM (3 pages)"   // The coding marathon mode
  },
  commonTypos: {
    mostFrequent: "fucntion",      // The classic
    runnerUps: ["retrun", "lenght", "recieve", "defualt", "Larvel"]
  }
};
```

**Most Common Typos Hall of Shame:**  
🏆 `fucntion` - The undisputed champion  
🥈 `retrun` - Because sometimes I'm in a hurry  
🥉 `Larvel` - My deepest apology to Mr. Otwell
