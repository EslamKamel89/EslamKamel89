## **👨‍💻 About Me**

I’m a **Python backend developer** with a full-stack background (Laravel, Vue, Flutter) — now diving deep into **Django** and **FastAPI** for scalable, production-grade APIs.

I love building systems that are:

* **Clean:** typed, tested, documented
* **Performant:** async-ready, containerized
* **Human-friendly:** clear structure, meaningful logs, readable code

**Currently exploring:** how to blend **Python backends + AI/ML** to build smarter, data-driven products — one Jupyter cell at a time.

---

## **🚀 Why You'll Enjoy Working With Me**

✔️ Django apps with DRF, Celery, Redis, and PostgreSQL — battle-tested
✔️ FastAPI endpoints that *actually* feel fast
✔️ Docker setups so portable they could run on a toaster
✔️ CI/CD pipelines that keep production calm and predictable

**Fun facts:**
🐧 I talk to my containers when they misbehave
🐍 I’m not saying Python is better… but my `__repr__()` says it is
☕ I treat caffeine as infrastructure

## **🛠️ Tech Stack 2025**

### **Python Backend**

* **FastAPI** – async APIs, Pydantic models, OAuth2, SQLAlchemy
* **Django + DRF** – robust admin, ORM, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL
* **Pytest** – testing with fixtures and coverage
* **Docker + Docker Compose** – full dev environments
* **Gunicorn + Nginx** – production serving

### **Legacy & Frontend Superpowers**

* **Laravel + Livewire + Vue/Nuxt.js** – still part of my daily toolkit
* **Flutter** – mobile apps on Play Store & App Store
* **Tailwind CSS** – because UI should look good even for APIs (docs count as UI, right?)

---

## **📚 Learning & Growth**

I’m currently pursuing a **2-year AI/ML learning plan (2024–2026)** —
~6 months completed so far.

Focus areas:

* Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
* NLP and RAG (Hugging Face, LangChain)
* Deployment (FastAPI, Docker, AWS)

🧠 Goal: transition from “backend dev” to “AI-ready backend engineer.”

---

## **🐳 DevOps & Tools**

* **GitHub Actions** – test → build → deploy
* **AWS (EC2, ECS, S3, Route53)** – still wondering why it costs more than my coffee budget
* **Postman / pytest / curl** – for poking APIs until they behave

---

## **🤝 Let’s Connect**

```python
if you.like_my_code:
    print("Let’s build something awesome together!")
else:
    print("Feedback also welcome — I’ll log it and retry.")

*P.S. Still refactoring my sleep schedule into async tasks.*
